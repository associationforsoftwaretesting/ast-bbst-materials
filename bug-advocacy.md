# AST-BBST Bug Advocacy

## Bug Advocacy: Effective Bug Investigation and Reporting

### Overview

Bug reports are not just neutral technical reports. They are persuasive documents. The key goal of the bug report author is to provide high-quality information, well written, to help stakeholders make wise decisions about which bugs to fix. Key aspects of the content of this course include:

* Defining key concepts \(such as software error, quality, and the bug processing workflow\)
* The scope of bug reporting \(what to report as bugs, and what information to include\)
* Bug reporting as persuasive writing
* Bug investigation to discover harsher failures and simpler replication conditions
* Excuses and reasons for not fixing bugs
* Making bugs reproducible
* Lessons from the psychology of decision-making: bug-handling as a multiple-decision process dominated by heuristics - and biases
* Style and structure of well-written bug reports
* More info on the Learning Objectives for Bug Advocacy: Effective Bug Investigation and Reporting are available on the BBST.info website.

### Lecture 1: Basic Concepts Explore the diversity of opinions about "quality" and "bugs." 

The lecture presents the multi-dimensional view of quality used throughout the BBST courses.

* Lecture 1 \(35 mins\)  

### Lecture 2: Effective Advocacy: Making People Want to Fix the Bug 

How to develop reports that clearly communicate bugs in their harshest honest light so that decision-makers can operate with insight into the consequences of each bug.

* Lecture 2 \(27 mins\)  

### Lecture 3: Anticipating and Dealing with Objections: Irreproducible Bugs 

Strategies for exploring non-reproducible bugs to make them reproducible or at least to provide information to help troubleshooting efforts.

* Lecture 3 \(17 mins\)  

### Lecture 4: Anticipating and Dealing with Objections: The Content, Clarity, and Credibility of the Report 

How testers can make their reports useful and more credible for better decision-making by others working in the development effort.

* Lecture 4 \(12 mins\)  

### Lecture 5: Credibility and Influence 

In addition to the quality of bug reports, a tester's actions can influence how much credibility and influence they have on a project. This lecture draws on research on bias and signal detection theory to explore some of the things that enhance or diminish a tester's credibility.

* Lecture 5 \(21 mins\)  

### Lecture 6: Writing Clear Bug Reports 

The final lecture introduces the RIMGEN acronym to guide testers in writing better bug reports.

* Lecture 6 \(29 mins\)
